# FRMIS: Fast and Robust Feature-based Stitching Algorithm for Microscopic Images

Fast and Robust Microscopic Image Stitching (FRMIS) is a fast and robust automatic stitching algorithm to generate a consistent whole-slide image. This algorithm utilizes dominant SURF features from a small part of the overlapping region to achieve pairwise registration and consider the number of matched features in the global alignment. It implements global alignment algorithms such as Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Shortest Path Spanning Tree (SPT) for aligning the images. FRMIS is designed to stitch 2D microscopic images from different image modalities, including bright-field, phase-contrast, and fluorescence. 

## Usage Steps

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the MATLAB script `start_stitch.m`.

3. Customize the script by setting the following parameters:
    
     - `Optimization_option`: Choose between 'False' and 'True' to enable/disable optimization.  
        - **Optimization = Optimization_option{1}**: Disables registration optimization.  
        - **Optimization = Optimization_option{2}**: Enables registration optimization.

    - `GlobalRegistration_option`: Choose between 'MST' and 'SPT' for global registration.  
        - **GlobalRegistration = GlobalRegistration_option{1}**: Chooses 'MST' (Minimum Spanning Tree) for global registration.  
        - **GlobalRegistration = GlobalRegistration_option{2}**: Chooses 'SPT' (Shortest Path Spanning Tree) for global registration.

    - `blend_method_options`: Choose between 'Overlay' and 'Linear' for blending method.  
       - **blend_method = blend_method_options{1}**: Chooses 'Overlay' blending method.  
       - **blend_method = blend_method_options{2}**: Chooses 'Linear' blending method
      
    - `alpha`: Alpha value for linear blending.
    
    - `dataset_dir`: Directory containing the images to be stitched.
    
    - `dataset_name`: Name of the dataset.
    
    Specific parameters related to your dataset, which are accessible through the Whole-Slide Imaging (WSI) technique, such as:
    - `width`: Width of image grid (number of columns).
    - `height`: Height of image grid (number of rows).
    - `overlap`: Overlap percentage between adjacent tiles.
    - `img_num`: Total number of tiles.
    - `img_type`: Image file type.
    - `sort_type`: Sorting type indicates the pattern of the grid (the sequence of capturing tiles).  
      - **sort_type = 1**: Indicates the pattern shown below:    
      ![1,1,1,2](https://github.com/labCOI/FRMIS/assets/60792530/642be80e-30ed-4553-a5ec-675348643044)

      - **sort_type = 2**: Indicates the pattern shown below:  
      ![1,3,2,2](https://github.com/labCOI/FRMIS/assets/60792530/f1720eb1-6854-40e2-9b38-7d04addd923c)

    - `modality`: Imaging modality to adjust the SURF's threshold value.     
      - **modality = modality_option{1}**: Indicates the BrightField modality.    
      - **modality = modality_option{2}**: Indicates the Phase & Fluorescent modality.

## Notes

- Make sure to provide the correct path to the directory containing your dataset.

- Adjust the parameters according to the properties of your dataset for optimal stitching results.

- This script assumes that the images are named in a sequential order and can be sorted accordingly. If your images have a different naming convention, you may need to modify the sorting logic.
  - An example of the sequential order of image names is shown below:

- Ensure that the necessary MATLAB toolboxes (such as Image Processing Toolbox) are installed and accessible.
